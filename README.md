## My process
- Started with building the laptop interface
- Further went to make the mobile interface and fix any possible errors
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

This was my first project which required me to interact with the dom
I also discovered that it is better to set the width of the body to 100vh intead of my usual 100%, since percentage is relative
Also by default height uses auto, to fit the content
### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
More research will be done on the use of the dom and using media queries



### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8262852/css-height-in-percent-not-working) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDn reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand media quries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
